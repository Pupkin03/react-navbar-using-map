        In this part of the company profile, you will need to include a brief
        introduction to your company, including where, when, and by whom the
        company was founded, the company mission statement, and/or the company
        vision and purpose. You do not necessarily have to include products or
        services in this section yet, but focus on your bigger meaning and how
        you stand out from competitors instead. Tell your story in a compelling
        way. For instance, HubSpot starts its About Us section with, “More than
        ten years ago, we had a vision — an inbound world.” HubSpot does not
        mention its products until further down the page.If you want to add your
